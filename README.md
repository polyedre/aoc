# Advent of Code Solutions Repository

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code programming challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a series of coding puzzles, each released daily leading up to Christmas. The challenges cover a variety of programming concepts and are a great way to improve problem-solving skills.

## Structure

The repository is organized by year, with each year having its own directory. Within each year's directory, you'll find a separate folder for each programming language I used.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my personal implementations of the Advent of Code challenges. They may not always represent the most optimal or efficient solutions. The primary goal is to solve the puzzles, learn rust and share the code.

## Contributing

If you have more efficient solutions or want to suggest improvements, feel free to create a pull request. I welcome constructive feedback and collaboration.
